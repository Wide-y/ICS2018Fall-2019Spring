# Lab 1 Bit operation
## Over view
This lab is the first lab, and it is given a long time to do. </br>
It doesn't require very well programming skills, but some tricks or math.</br>
It will be easy to debug and it is worthwhile if you spend time on 
training your programming style.
## Difficulties
### Bitcount
Bit count may be one of the most difficult problems in this lab, but teacher may tell you how to do in class.</br>
It uses a smart way to simultaneously compute the bit in every byte.
If you understand how to solve this problem, others will be solved as well</br>
