# Online Test
## Overview
* Online test is not difficult, but time is limited.</br>
* It only contains some part of Lab 2, and some part of Lab 3.</br>
* The socre you got in this test will be computed with other labs except Lab 2 and Lab 3. </br>
* Before online test, it is strongly recommended that you spend time reviewing the Lab2 and Lab3, content of Labs and online test are almost the same. So, if you review, it will be very easy, or it may cost much time to do.
## My feeling
### Online Test -- Lab2
* We have 4 phases in lab2 part. 3 normal phase and 1 secret phase.
* Phase are almost the same as what you did in Lab2, and the secret phase is easier than Lab2.
* Make use of gdb tool, print message rather than musing at unsderstanding the code.
### Online Test -- Lab3
* We have 3 phases in lab3 part. 2 are solved by directly insert code, while 1 is solved by making use of exsiting code.
* If you did not review, you are likely make mistakes.
* I did not review, and during online test, mistaked the address order which confused me.
