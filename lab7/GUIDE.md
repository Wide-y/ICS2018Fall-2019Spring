#Lab 7 Memory Allocator
## Overview
This lab requires not only correctness but both space and time performance.</br>
Most of the code are the same as what CMU teachers demonstrated in their book, and it really count that you unsdertand every line of the code.</br> 
Only use segregated free list is enough to get a good score</br>
You can also use some datastructure like AVL / RB Tree
## My feeling
### Debug
Debug is difficult in this lab.
